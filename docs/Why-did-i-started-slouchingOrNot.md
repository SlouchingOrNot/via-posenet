# Why Did i start SlouchingOrNot Project ?
Two months ago, i hurt my back. It was one of the thoughest pain i ever felt.
I yelled loudly enougth to scare my neighbors more than once. Not a pleasant
time to go thru... Dont worry, now it is all good and healed :)


What i want to tell you is what is the positive that came out of it.
While lying there unable to move.

I love AI, this is new fresh and appears so powerfull.
But as all power, it may be dangerous.

So i wanted to find an interesting problem of AI, something which was clearly
for the good.

I wanted an actual problem, not something theorical, something practical which
helps people in the reality.

And my back was hurting, so ... what about that.. could i help people reduces
with backpain ?
I do computer all days, i have seen the back postures of people when they code
all days. Many people are slouching and stay in this position for hours. This is
an actual problem, and this is about my peers, people using computer all days.
This is close to home.

I was convinced this will be a nice project to experiment with modern AI. It was
simple, defined, it was exciting and original.

What if a webapp could use the webcam of a computer and determine if the personn
in front of the computer is slouching or not ?

This problem is very relevant to me,
i do computer all days, most people i know do the same. if slouchingOrNot helps
people having less back problem at their desk, it will help people around me, people
i care about.

It has a personnal goal, too. At my desk, i dont sit up as i should. slouchingOrNot will help me too.
