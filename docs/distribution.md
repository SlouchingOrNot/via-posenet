# How to put this on front of the people who may be interested
If this project is about helping people, we need let them know that this project exist.
Without that, they can't use the application which would help as they just don't
know about it.

In marketing, it is often called  this is called how to distribute the application.

# distribution channels
- link with pomodoro
- chrome/firefox/edge browser extension
- leverage hubs
  - people who give advice on back pain, get them to know slouchingOrNot

# Going Mobile!
Currently slouchingOrNot requires a webcam connected to a computer.
It isn't too strong of a requirement, it happens that many people are often slouching
close to a computer with a webcam, e.g. people using computer in a office.
While it is a significant amount of people, we could have a larger impact by removing
this limitation

Requiring of a computer with a webcam limits the slouchingOrNot detection to a specific location, your office desk.
We could helps more people if slouchingOrNot could be more mobile and use it in other places: e.g. in your car,
in the bus, at school anywhere.

## Specific Hardware
The standalone device could be a cheap specific hardware. slouchingOrNot requires only a camera and a cheap hardware.
Something like arduino-style would have enough power to do it.
Obviously the package will be a nice clean box.

## Phone
Mobile phone could run slouchingOrNot.
Phone are already very popular, so people could use slouchingOrNot without paying for new hardware

- PRO: specific hardware is expensive and hard to manufacture. The specificity of the Hardware
  is not the plus of the product. It doesn't seem a good move at first stage.
- PRO: phone are already paid for, so slouchingOrNot can reuse this 'free' hardware
- CON: need the phone to be in a stable position, and in a good position
  - the cradle to put the phone in a proper position is key
  - to keep the phone camera with a constant angle is something people recording
    video need too. Aka look at camera mount for phone.
